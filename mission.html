            <h1>the Mission</h1>
            <p class="mission-text">Before BitBox became a company it had a
            mission. It was built to accomplish a social mission—to empower
            people to create and transmit value.</p>
            <p class="mission-text">We think it’s important that everyone who
            invests in BitBox understands what this mission means to us, how we
            make decisions, and why we do the things we do. I will try to
            outline our approach in this letter.</p>
            <p class="mission-text">At BitBox, we’re inspired by technologies
            that can revolutionize how people create, transmit, and consume
            value. We often talk about inventions like the automobile and the
            cell phone— by simply making moving things and people’s voices
            easier, they led to a complete transformation of many important
            parts of society. They empowered people. They enabled progress.
            They changed the way society was organized. They made us more
            prosperous.</p>
            <p class="mission-text">Today our society has reached another
            tipping point. We live at moment when the majority of people in the
            world have access to the Internet. What they have lacked are the
            raw tools to create and transmit value wherever they want however
            they want with whomever they want. At BitBox we’re building an
            organization that gives people the power to create and transmit
            value and once again transform our world.</p>
            <p class="mission-text">There is a huge need and a huge opportunity
            to bring these tools to people who have never touched them before.
            The scale of the technology and infrastructure that must be built
            is unprecedented. The scale of the field of opportunities too is
            unprecedented. But the tools alone are not enough. As the
            Internet’s recent history has shown, tools without understanding
            can quickly turn from boon to bane. In order to truly bring power
            to the people, we have to bring knowledge—the know-how to use the
            tools. We believe this is the most important problem we can focus
            on: bringing together the people who share our mission to build the
            services and products that will empower people and shipping them
            along with the insights necessary for them to achieve maximum
            positive impact.</p>
            <p class="mission-text">Our profits further our purpose. Everyone
            who joins our team, investors and builders alike should understand
            this. Every aspect of our business is a reflection of our mission.
            Everyone who works at BitBox is expected to carry our message in
            them. Our technology and our products, like bitcoin, are ultimately
            an expression of the values we hold. In this way, BitBox, like the
            bitcoin community, itself is a movement.</p>
            <p class="mission-text">Today tremendous value is hidden and
            trapped. We believe that if we can unleash and unveil this value we
            can transform the essential nature of the process of value, make
            the world more equitable, more of a reflection of the values of
            all, and improve the lives of every person on the planet.</p>
            <p class="mission-text">I’m excited to set out on this adventure, I
            trust you are too. It’s going to be a wild ride.</p>
